If they didn’t, we might find ourselves living in a society of very solitary people, who had learned to control their distress rather than to find strength through sharing it.” – Naomi Stadlen</h4>

It is as if the world returns after annihilation and astounds anew with its robins and spaghetti and cut grass. In that moment of abrupt calm there is no good or bad or should or shouldn’t, just gratefulness to recognize once again the distant drone of a lawnmower, the tittering gossip of the chickens as they take a wide berth around the dog.” – Sarah Menkedick</h4>
